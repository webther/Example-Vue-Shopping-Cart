# Vue Example

> This example uses Vuex to manage the application's states in a shopping cart system.
> * Vue components retrieve/update state from Vuex store, a centralized state management tool.
> * Dividing the Vuex store into modules. Each module contains its own state, mutations, actions, and getters so it will make your code cleaner.
